A deep learning project implementing CNN and MLP models, with tools for Grad-CAM visualization, training management, and evaluation under degradation or adversarial conditions.
<details>
<summary>ðŸŽ¯ Objectives<\summary>
The exercises are designed to explore the behavior of different neural network architectures and techniques, focusing on training dynamics, regularization, and model interpretability.

- *MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)**
  - Analyze the **vanishing gradient problem**
  - Compare **deep vs. medium vs. shallow** networks
  - Evaluate the effect of different **regularization strategies**:
    - Dropout (low, medium, aggressive)
    - Batch Normalization
    - Data Augmentation

- *CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)**
  - Test **data augmentation as regularization**
  - Show that **deeper does not always mean better**
  - Demonstrate improvements with **skip connections**

- *Grad-CAM (Model Interpretability)**
  - Generate **standard Grad-CAM visualizations**
  - Assess robustness under **FGSM adversarial attacks**
    - Notable examples on digits **4, 1, and 7**
