# proj3

A deep learning project implementing NLP experiments, including **feature extraction with classifiers**, **transformer fine-tuning**, and **German grammatical error correction**.

> **NB:** All experiments in this repository are explained here in the initial `README.md`. Each script can be run independently.

<summary>ðŸŽ¯ Objectives</summary>

The exercises are designed to explore different NLP tasks and modeling strategies:

- **Feature Extraction + Baseline Classifiers**
  - Script: main_fine_tuning.py
  - Extract embeddings from pre-trained transformers
  - Train **SVM** and **Random Forest** classifiers on Rotten Tomatoes
  - Evaluate classification performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)

- **Fine-tuning Transformer (DistilBERT)**
  - Script: main_fine_tuning.py
  - Fine-tune **DistilBERT** for binary sentiment classification
  - Evaluate on validation and test sets
  - Save fine-tuned models for further use

- **German Grammatical Error Correction (GEC)**
  - Script: german.py
  - Train **T5-small with LoRA adapters** on MERLIN dataset (German)
  - Implement correction pipeline for sentences
  - Log corrections with:
    - Original sentence
    - Corrected version
    - Error type
    - Confidence score
    - Semantic similarity
    - Whether a change was applied
